Payday loans are credit facilities that are designed to be advanced for short time frames. The concept of 'Payday Loans' is not a new one, especially if you live in the western part of the world. There are numerous debtors who prefer to avail this facility and borrow money during exigencies, preferably repayable by the forthcoming payday. But is the picture so rosy? Like all other private lenders, payday loans also have some hidden facts and dubious lending practices that can easily trap a gullible borrower.

Here is a list of unfair practices that your payday lender will never reveal.

Exorbitant interest rates

Payday loans are available under the cloak of easier lending terms, quicker processing, flexible repayment terms and waiver of credit checks. However, all such good things also carry an interest cost in the form of 'Annual Percentage Rate'. This interest rate can extend up 700 percentile of the loan amount and increase the financial liabilities of a borrower.
